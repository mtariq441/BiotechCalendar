Nice — love this idea. Below is a complete, practical website structure for a biotech calendar that tracks FDA trials & data readouts, shows AI explanations, and provides scenario-based stock forecasting. I cover pages, UI components, data model, APIs, AI integration, realtime updates, tech stack suggestions, security, and a few ready-to-use JSON examples and prompt templates you can drop into your backend.

1 — Product summary (one-liner)

A realtime, interactive biotech calendar that aggregates FDA/clinical-trial events and, on click, displays AI-generated explanations, likely scenarios and scenario-based stock-price forecasts — with alerts, watchlists, and fast, clean UI.

2 — High-level sitemap

Home / Landing

Calendar (main interactive view)

Event / Readout Detail (AI Analysis + Scenarios)

Company / Trial Page

Watchlist & Alerts

Search & Filters

Dashboard (logged-in user)

Admin / Data Management (ingestion, mappings)

Account & Settings (subscriptions, API keys)

Docs / About / Privacy & Terms

3 — Key user stories / flows

Visitor -> open Calendar -> see upcoming FDA events (date tiles) -> click event -> view AI explanation + scenario forecasts + linked companies -> add to watchlist or set alert.

Logged-in user -> create custom filters (phase, sponsor, date range, drug type) -> subscribe to email/push alerts.

Power user/API consumer -> query events, fetch AI report via API, export CSV.

Admin -> configure data sources, correct scraped metadata, retrain/refresh forecasting models.

6 — API endpoints (examples)

Public:

GET /api/v1/events?from=2026-01-01&to=2026-02-01&filters=phase:3 — list events

GET /api/v1/events/{id} — event detail (includes ai_analysis_id if available)

GET /api/v1/companies/{ticker} — company page

POST /api/v1/users/{id}/watchlist — add watch

Internal:

POST /internal/ingest/fda-event — ingest webhook or scraped event

POST /internal/ai/analyze — trigger AI analysis for event (payload: event_id)

GET /internal/ai/status/{event_id} — status of analysis

Webhook:

POST /webhooks/alerts — user-specified webhook delivery for alerts

7 — Real-time & updates architecture

Ingest: scheduled scrapers + official FDA feeds + ClinicalTrials.gov + RSS + presswire

Normalization pipeline: ETL service that maps raw feeds -> canonical Event object

Streaming updates to clients:

Use WebSockets / Server-Sent Events (SSE) for live calendar updates

Redis pub/sub or Kafka for backend event distribution

Cache: Redis for hot event data & user watchlists

Background workers: Celery / RQ / Bull (node) for heavy tasks (AI generation, price simulations)

8 — AI analysis & forecasting design
Inputs to AI

Event metadata: type, endpoints, trial design, NCT summary

Historical outcomes for similar events (phase, indication)

Sponsor financials & recent news

Real-time market data for related tickers

Volatility surface / options data (if available) to infer market-implied probabilities

Outputs

Short human summary (2–3 lines)

Key factors & thresholds to watch

3–5 scenarios (name, probability)

For each scenario: narrative, price path (point estimates + bands), recommended actions (optional)

Confidence score & explanation of model limitations

Models & approach

Retrieval + LLM pipeline:

Retriever gathers structured data + docs

LLM (e.g., fine-tuned / instruction-tuned model) composes narrative & scenarios

Quantitative simulator generates price paths:

Monte Carlo on historical vol + event-specific shock

Option-implied distribution when options data present

Post-process: calibrate scenario probabilities using historical similarity model (e.g., nearest neighbors on trial feature space)

Prompt template (example)
System: You are an expert biotech analyst. Use the provided event data and historical outcomes to produce:
1) A 2-3 sentence plain-English summary
2) Three scenarios: Bull, Base, Bear — each with a probability that sums to 1 and a 3-sentence rationale
3) For each scenario, produce a 30-day price path as a list of daily prices (date, price) relative to the current close
Data: {event_meta}, {trial_details}, {historical_examples}, {current_price}, {vol_surface}
Constraints: do not provide legal/medical advice. Mark model confidence between 0-1.

9 — Stock forecasting technical approach (practical)

If options available: derive implied vol and risk-neutral distribution → scenario shocks based on tail probabilities.

If no options: use historical volatility for ticker + apply event-specific shock ranges derived from historical readouts for similar indications.

Monte Carlo simulations with scenario-specific mean drift adjustments.

Provide median & 10/90 percentile bands for each scenario. Show chart in UI.

10 — Tech stack (recommended)

Frontend: React + Next.js (SSR for SEO) + Tailwind CSS (clean UI) + Recharts / Chart.js for graphs

Backend: FastAPI (Python) or Node (Express/NestJS) — API layer

Worker & AI orchestration: Python (Celery + Redis) or Node + Bull

Database: PostgreSQL (event relationships) + Elasticsearch for search

Cache: Redis

Message queue: Kafka or Redis Streams

AI models: OpenAI/GPT-like API or a hosted LLM; use vector DB (Pinecone/Weaviate) for retrieval

Market data: IEX / Polygon / Alpha Vantage / Yahoo Finance (depending on license)

Hosting: Vercel for frontend, AWS/GCP for backend + managed Postgres (RDS, Cloud SQL), Redis (Elasticache)

CI/CD: GitHub Actions

Monitoring: Sentry, Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog

11 — Security & compliance

Rate-limited APIs with API keys

Protect user PII and payment data (PCI compliant if payments)

Audit logs for admin actions

Data provenance: store source URLs and ingestion timestamps for each event

Disclaimers: forecasts are probabilistic & not financial advice

12 — Performance & UX optimizations

Lazy-load calendar tiles and AI analysis (generate on demand)

Cache AI outputs and mark stale vs fresh

Use paginated API and cursor-based lists

Minimize bundle size, use CDN for static assets

Mobile-first responsive design; keyboard-accessible calendar navigation

Accessibility: semantic HTML, ARIA on calendar components

13 — Analytics & metrics to track

DAU/MAU, events clicked per session, watchlist adds, alert conversion rate

Model usage: analysis per day, average latency, user feedback on analysis accuracy

Uptime & data freshness SLA (e.g., <5 minutes for high-priority events)

14 — Admin & ML ops

Versioned AI models and UI toggle to choose model

Feedback loop: allow users to rate AI analyses → feed back to training set

Retraining schedule and data curation tools

15 — Example wireframe notes (quick)

Left: Filter / Search column (collapsible)

Center: Calendar grid (month view). Each day shows stacked color-coded event chips.

Right or modal: Event detail with tabs (Summary | Analysis | Docs | Price Chart)

Floating FAB: Add alert / Quick watch

16 — Minimal MVP scope (to build fast)

Event ingestion from ClinicalTrials.gov + FDA calendar

Basic interactive calendar (month + list)

Single-event AI analysis (on-demand generation)

Watchlist + simple email alerts

Basic price simulation using historical vol (no options data)
Aim for this MVP to validate demand before adding heavy realtime streaming or complex option-implied modeling.

18 — Next practical steps (if you want me to continue)

I can generate: detailed DB schema SQL, API OpenAPI spec, React component skeletons for the calendar and event modal, or a product requirements doc (PRD) with acceptance criteria.

Tell me which of the above you want next and I’ll produce it right away.
